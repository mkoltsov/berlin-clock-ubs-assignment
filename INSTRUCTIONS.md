# Instructions

## Things to do to prepare for the UBS interview
 - ensure that your machine has a Java JDK installed on it (we are assuming Java 7 will be used)
 - install Gradle (www.gradle.org) on the machine you will be running the interview (we have used Gradle 1.6)
 - install an IDE of your choice to perform the interview (we have used Jetbrains Intellij)
 - included with this archive is an example project that is built using gradle, before the interview you should familiarise yourself with working on a Gradle project in the IDE of your choice.
 - when your environment is set up correctly running `gradle check` from the command line should complete successfully.

## We value
 - simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative
 - transparency and feedback to support continuous learning
 - excellent testing that acts as documentation
 - challenging boundaries where necessary

## What to expect from our process
 - we will send you a similar archive to this one with a README.md file that will describe to you what we need from you for the interview
 - you will have one hour to complete the interview, after which you will need to create a new archive including your solution and send it back to us (reply to the sender)
 - we will then review your solution and feedback to you opportunities for improving the solution
 - we will independently review with your agent whether we will pursue your application further
